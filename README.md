# Movies Webpage
A simple webpage listing out some good and pointful movies that I have seen (or will see).
<p></p>
Any suggetion for the page, or additions to the list itself, would be greatly appreciated

## Links
- <a href=https://skaar513.github.io>movies</a>
- <a href=https://skaar513.github.io/startpage>startpage</a>

## Issues
<p>1. The background doesn't load properly when the webpage is not as long as the height of the device. </p
<p>2. The heading font does not render properly on gecko based browsers (like firefox).<br>Font settings in about:config needs to be edited to make it chromium/brave-like, but there's no documentation.</p>
