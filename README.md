# My webpages
This repo is a collection of my web pages :

### Startpage
This is the main page I've been working on (for personal use, ofcourse). It's src is in testing/, but is not yet complete.<br><br>
Earlier I was going to make a front-end to edit the basic settings, but it turns out that permanent changes to offline files are not possible with js in any way (however, it is possible if the page is a browser extension) (This is quite apparent why, but I was too occupied with shell scripting).<br>
BTW, It is actually possible to write to files with js, but it is temporarily stored in browser cache, and would make the edit buttons meaningless.<br><br>
PS - Feel free to skip ahead, javascript is frustrating.

### Great Movies
A simple webpage listing out some good and pointful movies that I have seen (or will see).

Any suggestion for the page, or additions to the list itself, would be greatly appreciated.
