# My webpages
This repo is a collection of my web pages :

### Startpage
This is the main page I've been working on (for personal use). It's src is in testing/, but isn't complete yet.<br><br>
Earlier I was going to make a front-end to edit the basic settings, but it turns out that permanent changes to offline files are not possible with js in any way (however, it is possible if the page is a browser extension) (This is quite apparent why, but I was too occupied with shell scripting).<br>
BTW, It is actually possible to write to files with js, but it is temporarily stored in browser cache, which may cause inconvinience to the user.<br>
The only sure shot way to make the startpage reliable is to edit the source code directly, which means my work-in-progress "edit buttons" are kindof useless. It turns out i'll have to resort to my end-game plan, that is to fork brave.<br><br>
PS - Feel free to skip ahead, javascript is frustrating.<br>
PS reloaded - Oh M G! I am a genius. Instead of making a frontend for editing bookmarks, why don't I just refer the button to open the chromium bookmarks menuuuuu, hurraayyy. The engines edit button would still be a problem, but that doesn't really matter as the defaults are great already.<br><br>

### Great Movies
A simple webpage listing out some good and pointful movies that I have seen (or will see).

Any suggestion for the page, or additions to the list itself, would be greatly appreciated.
